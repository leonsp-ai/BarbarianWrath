# Barbarian Wrath Modpack for Civ2: Test of Time

## Features

- Barbarians are a tier ahead of the vanilla game
- Option to play on the secret Barbarian Wrath intensity
- Both the vanilla Civilization II scenarios, Rome and WW2, converted to the Test of Time format
- Three world maps with a unique polar perspective
- Leaders revised for historicity

## Overview

Civilization 2 has a hidden barbarian intensity beyond Raging Hordes. This modpack adds it as a choice to the menu when starting a new game.

Beyond the intensity, every barbarian horde you see will be a tier higher.

Instead of Elephants and Archers, you'll face Crusaders and Legions.

Instead of Riflemen and Artillery, you'll face Marines and Howitzers.

Instead of Partisans and Cavalry, you'll face Alpine Troops and Early Armor.

Greater barbarian presence is also a good influence on the AI. When the AI is busy fending off barbarians it has less time to be a jerk.

## Why Grenadiers?

The Gunpowder technology and the Musketeer slot have hardcoded side effects. I introduced Grenadiers with a higher attack than Musketeers but same defense to work around those side effects. They become available with Metallurgy.

Similarly, Early Armor is there to introduce a more gentle power curve between Cavalry and Armor and to work with the default sound effects.
